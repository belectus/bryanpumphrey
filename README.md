### Hi, I'm Bryan 👋🏾👨🏾‍💻
#### UX/UI Design 

I am a newly minted UX/UI Design Graduate I spent the majority of my educational life
balancing the abstract and concrete portions of my mind
Balance in all things is important The function should not
only meet fashion but their intermingling should be as
natural as a leaf blowing in a nice breeze

##Skills and Exprience: Tools: Figma, Zeplin , Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, Miro, Lookback
